CHAPTER: SOFTWARE TESTING

Software testing is the process of evaluating a system to identify
defects and ensure that it meets specified requirements. A robust
testing strategy should combine unit, integration, system, and
acceptance testing.

Key points:
- Test early and test continuously.
- Keep test cases clear, repeatable, and traceable.
- Prioritize high-risk modules first.

Common defects include:
1. Boundary condition failures
2. Incorrect business rule handling
3. Broken user input validation

Conclusion
Testing improves product quality, reduces release risk, and
increases confidence for students and teachers using the app.
